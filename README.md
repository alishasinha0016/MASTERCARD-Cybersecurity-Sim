TASK 2:

Create a short presentation

Now that you've analyzed the results, it's time to create a short presentation (3-5 slides) providing some awareness and training materials for the two teams that appear to be most susceptible. This will help us improve the security awareness of the teams that performed poorly in this campaign.

Remember that employees at times view training as boring - so try to make the presentation clear, concise and easy to understand. Try to educate employees on what phishing is, as well as provide examples of tactics often used. Use any resources you choose, the more creative, the better!
